## Content
- the aim is to develop material for a 90min remote, video-call session
- using the README-template from Cornell University Library
- and using the accompanying materials from Cornell University Library (see [Guide to writing "readme" style documentation](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/readme))
- and using a small selection of blog posts and articles that focus on the benefits of README-style metadata for research data
